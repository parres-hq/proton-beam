## 🚀 How to Use

### For Daily Development

```bash
# Make your changes
# ...

# Before committing
just precommit

# If working on performance
just bench-save  # Before changes
# Make optimizations
just bench-save  # After changes
just bench-history  # Compare
```

### When Creating a PR

```bash
# Ensure local checks pass
just precommit

# Push your branch
git push origin your-branch

# Create PR on GitHub
# CI will automatically run:
#   - Format, lint, docs, tests (always)
#   - Benchmarks (if you touched performance files)

# Review CI results in PR
# Fix any issues
# Merge when all checks pass
```

### Viewing CI Results

1. Go to your PR on GitHub
2. Scroll to checks section
3. Click "Details" on any check
4. Review logs

Or:

1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Select workflow run
3. Download artifacts (for benchmarks)

### Tracking Benchmarks Over Time

```bash
# CI automatically tracks on main branch

# For local tracking
just bench-save  # Saves to benchmark-results/

# View history
just bench-history

# Compare specific runs
just bench-compare OLD.txt NEW.txt
```

## ❓ Questions?

### Benchmarks
- **"Should I run benchmarks?"** → See `BENCHMARK_PRACTICES.md`
- **"How do I read results?"** → See `BENCHMARK_SUMMARY_ANSWER.md`
- **"CI benchmark failed"** → Check artifacts, compare manually

### CI/CD
- **"CI failed, now what?"** → Check logs, run `just precommit` locally
- **"How do I add a check?"** → Edit `ci.yml`, add job
- **"Can I skip CI?"** → Only for docs (add `[skip ci]` to commit)

### General
- **Documentation** → Start at `docs/INDEX.md`
- **Commands** → See `docs/JUSTFILE_COMMANDS.md`
- **Issues** → Open GitHub issue with details
